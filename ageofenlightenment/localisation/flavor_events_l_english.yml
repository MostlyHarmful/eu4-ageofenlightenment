 flavor_bav.201.t:1 "From the 6th-8th century, the Duchy of Bavaria was a frontier region in the southeastern part of the Merovingian kingdom and was ruled by dukes under Frankish lordship. In the late 9th century a new duchy was created from this area. It was one of the stem duchies of the Kingdom of Germany and the Holy Roman Empire.\n\nBetween 1070 and 1180 the Emperor was opposed by Bavaria, especially by the House of Welf. In the final conflict between Duke Henry the Lion and the Hohenstaufen emperor Frederick I, Frederick triumphed and deprived Henry of his fiefs. Bavaria then passed over to the House of Wittelsbach. Since there was no preference for succession of the firstborn in the Wittelsbach dynasty, Bavaria was subdivided between different branches of the Wittelsbach dynasty into separate duchies, often at odds with one another.\n\nWe believe ourselves to be the sole legitimate claimant to the united Duchy of Bavaria. No longer shall we abide with mediocrity."
